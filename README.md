Downify is a powerful and efficient tool that bridges the gap between Spotify and YouTube. Leveraging a custom-built 
[Spotify API](https://spotipy-api.vercel.app/), Downify fetches the song name and artist information and then uses the Pytube library's search function to find and download the corresponding video from YouTube.

## Features

- **Spotify Integration**: Fetches song details including track name and artist using a custom [Spotify API](https://spotipy-api.vercel.app/).
- **YouTube Download**: Automatically searches for the track on YouTube and downloads it in audio format.
- **Simple & Intuitive**: A user-friendly interface that makes downloading your favorite tracks effortless.

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Song Details**: Downify retrieves the song name and artist from Spotify.
